# # aim:
#
# a time range from a to b with value x should be split into intervals
# each intervall should hold a fraction of x
#
# example:
# # data:
# a = 2019-01-01 21:00:00
# b = 2019-01-03 06:00:00
# x = 66
#
# # solution:
# intervalls = [
#     (2019-01-01,  6),
#     (2019-01-02, 48),
#     (2019-01-03, 12)
# ]
